    "# Analysis using Gemini 1.5 Pro\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook summarises the results of a quick analysis with Gemini 1.5 Pro, done via [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) on 2024-08-28. The core of the analysis was done via the studio interface for quicker iteration and to reduce costs, while taking advantage of Gemini 1.5 Pro's large context window.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps were run on Ubuntu 22.04:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download all the available PDFs to `raw_docs/` (up to submission 195 at the time of the analysis)\n",
    "2. In `raw_docs/`, convert all the PDFs to text files:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   $ for file in *.pdf; do pdftotext \"$file\" \"${file%.pdf}.txt\"; done\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Concatenate the text files to a single file, delimiting each file's contents with START/END headings:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    $ for file in Sub*.txt; do\n",
    "      echo \"START $file\"\n",
    "      echo \"---\"\n",
    "      cat \"$file\"\n",
    "      echo \"---\"\n",
    "      echo \"END $file\"\n",
    "    done > concatenated_output.txt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Convert `concatenated_output.txt` to PDF for upload to Gemini: Print to file from the text editor without page editing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in a single file with about 490k Gemini tokens (well within the 1M context window).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gemini chat analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- `FULL_CHAT_HISTORY` contains the chat from Google AI Studio.\n",
    "- Steps to reproduce are given at the bottom of the notebook.\n",
    "- The notebook presents highlights from the chat and parsing of structured outputs that repeats some of the analysis from `analysis.ipyb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any classification is inaccurate, especially since Gemini provided classifications for inexistent files. However, from spot-checking, many of the classifications are correct. Further, the high-level summarise by Gemini match the zeitgeist and general trends. \n",
    "- Further work is needed to quantify classification inaccuracies.\n",
    "- At the time of writing, submissions are still being processed, so the results may shift with new data."

They highlight the importance of recognizing the connection between Jewish identity and the State of Israel for most Jews.\\n* **Call for a Judicial Inquiry:** Jewish submitters overwhelmingly support the establishment of a judicial inquiry with robust powers to investigate antisemitism on campus, uncover the extent of the problem, hold universities accountable, and recommend effective solutions. \\n\",\n",

       "* **Rising Antisemitism on Campus:** Jewish submitters consistently report a significant increase in antisemitic incidents on Australian university campuses, particularly after the October 7th attacks, creating a hostile environment.\n",
       "* **Fear and Intimidation:** Many Jewish students express feeling unsafe and intimidated due to the prevalence of hate speech, harassment, and threats, often leading to self-censorship and avoidance of campus activities.\n",
       "* **Inadequate University Responses:**  Submitters criticize university administrations for their perceived inadequate and inconsistent responses to antisemitism, citing a lack of understanding, action, and support for Jewish students and staff.\n",
       "* **Anti-Zionism as a Form of Antisemitism:** Many Jewish individuals argue that the line between legitimate criticism of Israel and antisemitism is being blurred, with anti-Zionism often used as a disguise for Jew-hatred. They highlight the importance of recognizing the connection between Jewish identity and the State of Israel for most Jews.\n",

       "* **Support for a Broader Anti-Racism Approach:** Several non-Jewish submitters advocate for addressing antisemitism within a broader anti-racism framework, arguing that isolating antisemitism as a distinct issue can be counterproductive and risks overlooking other forms of racism.\n",
       "* **Emphasis on Free Speech and Academic Freedom:** Some raise concerns about the potential for a Commission of Inquiry to stifle free speech and academic freedom, particularly for those critical of Israeli policies, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach.\n",
       "* **Questioning the IHRA Definition:** A number of non-Jewish individuals express concerns about the proposed adoption of the IHRA definition of antisemitism, arguing that it could be misused to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel and Palestine.\n",
       "* **Support for Alternative Solutions:** While some support a judicial inquiry, others advocate for alternative approaches, such as strengthening existing anti-discrimination policies, promoting intercultural dialogue, and addressing the root causes of all forms of racism, including antisemitism. \n",

They highlight the importance of recognizing the connection between Jewish identity and the State of Israel for most Jews.\\n* **Call for a Judicial Inquiry:** Jewish submitters overwhelmingly support the establishment of a judicial inquiry with robust powers to investigate antisemitism on campus, uncover the extent of the problem, hold universities accountable, and recommend effective solutions. \\n\",\n",

Our focus should be on fostering a culture of respect and inclusion for all students, staff, and community members, regardless of their background or beliefs.\\\"\\n2. **Free Speech and Academic Freedom:** \\\"While we condemn all forms of hate speech, we must be cautious about using the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which could potentially stifle legitimate criticism of Israeli policies.  Universities are spaces for robust debate, and we must ensure that academic freedom is protected.\\\"\\n3. **Root Causes of Racism:** \\\"A Commission of Inquiry focused solely on antisemitism risks creating a hierarchy of racism and diverting attention from the systemic factors that allow all forms of racism to thrive.  We need a holistic approach that addresses the root causes of racism, including colonialism, white supremacy, and the ongoing dispossession of First Nations peoples.\\\" \\n\\n\\n## One Nation Senator\\n\\n1. **Protecting Our Students:** \\\"Jewish students deserve to feel safe on campus, just like every other student. The alarming rise in antisemitism, with cowardly university administrations failing to act, is a national disgrace. This inquiry is essential to expose the truth and hold those responsible accountable.\\\" \\n2. **No Tolerance for Terrorism:** \\\"Those who chant for 'intifada' and the destruction of Israel, celebrate the Hamas terrorists, and spread their vile propaganda are not engaging in free speech, they are inciting hatred and violence. Our universities have become breeding grounds for extremism, and this inquiry must address the threat to our national security.\\\"\\n3. **Standing Up for Israel:** \\\"Israel is a beacon of democracy in the Middle East and a staunch ally of Australia. The relentless attacks on Israel, often disguised as 'criticism,' are nothing more than thinly veiled antisemitism. This inquiry must expose the truth about Israel and stand up for our Jewish community.\\\" \\n\",\n",
